Process:
#### on site:
1. Acquire the evidence: Collect the digital devices such as laptops, storage devices, and digital cameras. (Note that laptops and computers require special handling if they are turned on; however, this is outside the scope of this room.)
2.  Establish a chain of custody: Fill out the related form appropriately ([Sample form](https://www.nist.gov/document/sample-chain-custody-formdocx)). The purpose is to ensure that only the authorized investigators had access to the evidence and no one could have tampered with it.
3.  Place the evidence in a secure container: You want to ensure that the evidence does not get damaged. In the case of smartphones, you want to ensure that they cannot access the network, so they donâ€™t get wiped remotely.
4.  Transport the evidence to your digital forensics lab.
#### in Lab:
1.  Retrieve the digital evidence from the secure container.
2.  Create a forensic copy of the evidence: The forensic copy requires advanced software to avoid modifying the original data.
3.  Return the digital evidence to the secure container: You will be working on the copy. If you damage the copy, you can always create a new one.
4.  Start processing the copy on your forensics workstation.

#### General guidelines:
-   Proper search authority: Investigators cannot commence without the proper legal authority.
-   Chain of custody: This is necessary to keep track of who was holding the evidence at any time.
-   Validation with mathematics: Using a special kind of mathematical function, called a hash function, we can confirm that a file has not been modified.
-   Use of validated tools: The tools used in digital forensics should be validated to ensure that they work correctly. For example, if you are creating an image of a disk, you want to ensure that the forensic image is identical to the data on the disk.
-   Repeatability: The findings of digital forensics can be reproduced as long as the proper skills and tools are available.
-   Reporting: The digital forensics investigation is concluded with a report that shows the evidence related to the case that was discovered.
