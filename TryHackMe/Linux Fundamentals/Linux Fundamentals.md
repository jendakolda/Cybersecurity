With our process backgrounded using either `Ctrl + Z` or the `&` operator, we can use `fg` to bring this back to focus like below, where we can see the `fg` command is being used to bring the background process back into use on the terminal, where the output of the script is now returned to us.

-   SIGTERM - Kill the process, but allow it to do some cleanup tasks beforehand
-   SIGKILL - Kill the process - doesn't do any cleanup after the fact
-   SIGSTOP - Stop/suspend a process
