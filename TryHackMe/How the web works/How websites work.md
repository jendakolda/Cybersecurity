There are two major components that make up a website:

1.  Front End (Client-Side) - the way your browser renders a website.
2.  Back End (Server-Side) - a server that processes your request and returns a response.

Websites are primarily created using:
-   HTML, to build websites and define their structure
-   CSS, to make websites look pretty by adding styling options
-   JavaScript, implement complex features on pages using interactivity

#### JavaScript
JavaScript (JS) is one of the most popular coding languages in the world and allows pages to become interactive. HTML is used to create the website structure and content, while JavaScript is used to control the functionality of web pages - without JavaScript, a page would not have interactive elements and would always be static. JS can dynamically update the page in real-time, giving functionality to change the style of a button when a particular event on the page occurs (such as when a user clicks a button) or to display moving animations.
