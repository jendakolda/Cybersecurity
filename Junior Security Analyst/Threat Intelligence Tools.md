Threat Intelligence is the analysis of data and information using tools and techniques to generate meaningful patterns on how to mitigate against potential risks associated with existing or emerging threats targeting organisations, industries, sectors or governments.

To mitigate against risks, we can start by trying to answer a few simple questions:

-   Who's attacking you?
-   What's their motivation?
-   What are their capabilities?
-   What artefacts and indicators of compromise should you look out for?

[**Urlscan.io**](https://urlscan.io/) is a free service developed to assist in scanning and analysing websites. It is used to automate the process of browsing and crawling through websites to record activities and interactions.

[Abuse.ch](https://abuse.ch/)  to identify and track malware and botnets through several operational platforms developed under the project. These platforms are:

-   ## [MalwareBazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/):**  A resource for sharing malware samples.
-   ## [FeodoTracker](https://feodotracker.abuse.ch/):**  A resource used to track botnet command and control (C2) infrastructure linked with Emotet, Dridex and TrickBot.
-   ## [SSL Blacklist](https://sslbl.abuse.ch/): A resource for collecting and providing a blocklist for malicious SSL certificates and JA3/JA3s fingerprints.
-   ## [URLhaus](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/): A resource for sharing malware distribution sites.
-   ## [ThreatFox](https://threatfox.abuse.ch/): A resource for sharing indicators of compromise (IOCs).

[**PhishTool**](https://www.phishtool.com/) Through email analysis, security analysts can uncover email IOCs, prevent breaches and provide forensic reports that could be used in phishing containment and training engagements.

Cisco Talos encompasses six key teams:

-   **Threat Intelligence & Interdiction:** Quick correlation and tracking of threats provide a means to turn simple IOCs into context-rich intel.
-   **Detection Research:** Vulnerability and malware analysis is performed to create rules and content for threat detection.
-   **Engineering & Development:** Provides the maintenance support for the inspection engines and keeps them up-to-date to identify and triage emerging threats.
-   **Vulnerability Research & Discovery:** Working with service and software vendors to develop repeatable means of identifying and reporting security vulnerabilities.
-   **Communities:** Maintains the image of the team and the open-source solutions.
-   **Global Outreach:** Disseminates intelligence to customers and the security community through publications.
