	After the investigation, the SOC team coordinates and takes actions on the compromised hosts, which involves isolating the hosts from the network, terminating the malicious processes, deleting files, and more.

There are many open-source databases out there like AbuseIPDB, Cisco Talos Intelligence, where you can perform a reputation and location check for the IP address. Most security analysts use these tools to aid them with alert investigations. You can also make the Internet safer by reporting the malicious IPs, for example, on AbuseIPDB.
