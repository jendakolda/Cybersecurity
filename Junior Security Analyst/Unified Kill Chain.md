The Unified Kill Chain is a framework which establishes the phases of an attack, and a means of identifying and mitigating risk to IT assets.

Threat modelling, in a cybersecurity context, is a series of steps to ultimately improve the security of a system. Threat modelling is about identifying risk and essentially boils down to:

1.  Identifying what systems and applications need to be secured and what function they serve in the environment. For example, is the system critical to normal operations, and is a system holding sensitive information like payment info or addresses?
2.  Assessing what vulnerabilities and weaknesses these systems and applications may have and how they could be potentially exploited
3.  Creating a plan of action to secure these systems and applications from the vulnerabilities highlighted
4.  Putting in policies to prevent these vulnerabilities from occurring again where possible (for example, implementing a software development life cycle (SDLC) for an application or training employees on phishing awareness).
