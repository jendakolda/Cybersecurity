composed of four core features:
- adversary, 
- infrastructure,
- capability,
- and victim,
and establishes the fundamental atomic element of any intrusion activity

Six possible meta-features can be added to the Diamond Model. Meta-features are not required, but they can add some valuable information or intelligence to the Diamond Model.
