1) RECON
	**Reconnaissance** is discovering and collecting information on the system and the victim. The reconnaissance phase is the planning phase for the adversaries. **OSINT** (Open-Source Intelligence) also falls under reconnaissance. **Email harvesting** is the process of obtaining email addressesfrom public, paid, or free services. An attacker can use email-address harvesting for a phishing attack
2) WEAPONIZATION
	**Malware** is a program or software that is designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to a computer.An **exploit** is a program or a code that takes advantage of the vulnerability or flaw in the application or system. A **payload** is a malicious code that the attacker runs on the system.
3) DELIVERY
	Phishing email, Distributing infected USB drives in public places, Watering hole attack. A watering hole attack is a targeted attack designed to aim at a specific group of people by compromising the website they are usually visiting and then redirecting them to the malicious website of an attacker's choice.
4) EXPLOITATION
	examples of how an attacker carries out exploitation:

-   The victim triggers the exploit by opening the email attachment or clicking on a malicious link.
-   Using a zero-day exploit.
-   Exploit software, hardware, or even human vulnerabilities. 
-   An attacker triggers the exploit for server-based vulnerabilities.

5) INSTALLATION 
6) command & control
	The compromised endpoint would communicate with an external server set up by an attacker to establish a command & control channel. After establishing the connection,  the attacker has full control of the victim's machine.
7) Exfiltration
